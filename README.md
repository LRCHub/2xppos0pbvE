[00:19.91] (Life is too precious to waste)
[00:26.18] (Life is too precious to waste)
[00:41.68] 
[00:45.97] Eyes go shut
[00:47.49] I dissipate
[00:48.81] Into thin air leaving no trace
[00:51.90] Distant voice
[00:53.32] Not listening
[00:54.89] Why don't you just save your breath?
[01:12.89] 
[00:57.36] All of your words feel like a jail
[01:00.42] That blocks the sun and makes me stale
[01:03.23] Not enough gold in all the world
[01:06.25] So why have I surrendered
[01:09.20] To your abusive ways?
[01:13.72] The cracks have opened up to the core
[01:19.24] Is there anywhere to go from here now?
[01:26.00] Sick with the lies consuming our souls
[01:45.00] 
[01:31.74] Give me one reason to take the breath we breathe for granted
[01:37.42] Hold it in so long that you forget to say
[01:43.27] Give me one reason to remain confined within the fences
[01:49.01] Here with you and my soul on display
[02:07.01] 
[02:06.03] Bite my tongue
[02:07.62] Swallow the pain
[02:09.14] A bit disturbed by these displays
[02:12.01] Now we've got nothing to say
[02:14.64] The silence growing deadly
[02:27.64] 
[02:17.48] So here we are drifting apart
[02:20.40] Neither willing to drop their guard
[02:23.29] Haven't we got something to say?
[02:26.28] The distance growing deadly
[02:39.78] 
[02:29.25] From years and years of pain
[02:33.54] The cracks go deeper than we can see
[02:39.40] Let's take a good look at where we are now
[02:46.24] Maybe the end's the start that we need
[03:05.24] 
[02:51.71] Give me one reason to take the breath we breathe for granted
[02:57.49] Hold it in so long that you forget to say
[03:03.15] Give me one reason to remain confined within the fences
[03:09.12] Here with you and my soul on display
[03:27.12] 
[03:26.12] (Bite my tongue, swallow the pain)
[03:29.04] (A bit disturbed by these displays)
[03:31.88] (Now we've got nothing to say)
[03:34.44] Life is too precious to waste
[03:48.94] 
[03:37.38] Give me one reason to take the breath we breathe for granted
[03:43.14] Hold it in so long that you forget to say
[03:48.84] Give me one reason to remain confined within the fences
[03:54.59] Stuck here with you and my soul on display
[04:15.59] 
[04:02.99] (Life is too precious to waste)
[04:14.45] (Life is too precious to waste)
